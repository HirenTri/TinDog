**Simon Game Project:**

1. **Classic Memory Game:**
   - Developed an interactive web-based version of the classic Simon memory game.
   - The game challenges players to repeat increasingly complex sequences of lights and sounds.

2. **Engaging Gameplay:**
   - Players must remember and replicate the sequence of lights and sounds presented by the game.
   - Each level adds a new step to the sequence, increasing the difficulty as players progress.

3. **Technology Stack:**
   - Utilized HTML and CSS for the basic structure and styling of the game interface.
   - Employed JavaScript and jQuery for game logic, user interactions, and dynamic updates to the game interface.
   - Implemented sound effects and animations to enhance the user experience.

This project showcases skills in creating interactive web applications, handling user input, and managing game state and logic.
